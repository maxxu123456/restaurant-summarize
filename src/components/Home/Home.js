We shared the appetizers and even then the portions were so large but every bite was delicious. I ordered the Chilean sea bass which was nicely charbroiled and cooked to perfection. The sauce wasnâ€™t heavy at all which made the fish shine! Even the rice and vegetables it came with were splendid. Order their sourdough and Bloody Mary!  And my goodness their bread pudding and even their berries and fruit and chocolate cake seemed simple but tasted Amazing. The menu is extensive but they can take the simpler things and make it amazingly well. I even had the lucky opportunity to have it for lunch during my trip and their clam chowder is also to die for! The atmosphere was great too. Still old school style. Staff had their uniforms on and they just have that old time feel. Reserve your tables! Each comes with a booth which can make for a nice intimate meal.",

But, it is way more expensive than it should be. I just can't justify paying over $50 (before tax and tip) for a smallish bowl of seafood. Unless the price is adjusted, I won't be coming back or recommending this place to my friends.",
